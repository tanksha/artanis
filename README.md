GNU Artanis needs a logo, contribution is welcome!
=========

NOTICE
=========
According to [GNU Ethical Repository Criteria Evaluations](https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.html). GNU Artanis as GNU official project is not proper to be maintained on GitHub.
So I **will not** do maintenance work for GNU Artanis on github to show my position on free software.
That means I **will not** response to issues or pull requests. Until GitHub show some respect to freedom of users on these issues:
* No other nonfree software is required to use the site (thus, no Flash). 
* Does not discriminate against classes of users, or against any country.

The maintenance repo will be these two:
* [GNU official repo](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/artanis.git/)
   Accepts patches and issues on mailing-list artanis@gnu.org

* [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/NalaGinrut/artanis)
   Accepts issues and pull requests.

For historical reasons, GNU Artanis will maintain the site with gh-pages on GitHub since the pages service on GitLab is very different so I can't just move it simply.
Before we have a better/modern Savannah, we have to endure this situation.

GNU Artanis
=========

GNU Artanis aims to be a web application framework for Scheme.
The philosophy of Artanis is to be very radical, and to try
cutting-edge things.
So use it at your own risk...however, playing with it may result in
some cool experiences!

## Features:

* GPLv3+ & LGPLv3+
* Very lightweight - easy to hack and learn for newbies.
* Support JSON/CSV/XML/SXML.
* A complete web-server implementation, including an error page handler.
* Aims to be a highly concurrent and performant server in the future.
* Has a Sinatra-like style route, hence the name "Artanis" ;-)
* Supported databases (through guile-dbi): MySQL/SQLite/PostgreSQL.
* Nice and easy web cache control.
* Efficient HTML template parsing.

* Contributing to the manual -

  The source to the manual is in the gh-pages branch.

* Contributing to the Artanis framework -

  Thank you very much for contributing! However, Artanis is still in Beta, which means the architecture design is prone to major changes.

  So at the moment we accept only tiny or obvious fixes - please **do not** make big changes, they won't be accepted!

## Thanks for testing!
